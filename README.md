# SpeedLimiter
SpeedLimiter mod for GTAV.

<h2>About</h2>
With this mod you can set the maximum speed your vehicle is allowed to go.
<br>You can add speed while the limiter is active to let the vehicle go to a higher speed or you can subtract speed to slow it down.
<br>This mod will remember the cars you have set a limiter on so you do not have to set a maximum speed each time you leave the vehicle.
